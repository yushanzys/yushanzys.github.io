                <p>The goal of AR4ML project is to build intelligent education applications to utilize Augmented Reality (AR) unique benefits in Machine
                    Learning (ML) education for K12 students. We hosted 10+ co-design sessions with stakeholders, including AI experts, middle school teachers, and students, to
                    understand students’ mindsets, and designed and implemented multiple AR mobile applications to
                    teach middle school students the concepts of multidimensional data objects, data similarity, content-based
                    recommendation system algorithms, and related ethical issues in real-life recommendations.</p>
                <p>We conducted 10+ user study sessions with middle school students with diverse backgrounds and analyzed user behaviors through verbal and non-verbal frameworks
                    and qualitative and quantitative methods. Results showed that participants had significant increases in knowledge gain and engagement, 
                    and developed more interests and confidence in their atituides towards AI knowledge. </p>

                <p>The goal is to build web-based tools to teach K12 students ML knowledge with content they are familiar with, and
                    eventually to build authoring tools for K12 teachers and enable them to design and build ML lessons that fit different
                    curriculums.</p>
                <p>We conducted 25 user study sessions with high school students to evaluate the glyph data visualization and interaction
                    design. We analyzed user behaviors through pre- and post- interviews and applied qualitative methods to evaluate participants’
                    ML knowledge gain, user satisfaction and effectiveness of the design. </p>

                <p>The goal is to build an AR mobile application to facilitate LEGO assembly. Two main functions included 1) detected pictures of the entire LEGO set and generate an animation of assembly process from beginning to the end. 
                    2) detected the ongoing assembled object step and prompted instructions for the next step.
